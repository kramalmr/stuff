              I spent my early years at TK and SD Islam Al-Falaah in Ciputat. I
              have never been curious to any specific field of study but I have
              always been interested in learning new things. Since then, I have
              been also playing games and watching foreign cartoons which led me
              to having a good understanding in English and it also gave me a
              wide interests in playing more games. At the last year of my
              Elementary School, Ive opened a new interest in wanting to know
              how games codes, commands, etc. work which then i gave huge
              interests on. And now i knew that it was a good choice for me to
              learn more about it.
              <br />
              <br />
              Glancing back to my years of Elementary School, i remember that i
              was always curious to know how games are made and how they work
              which led me to learning a bit of it, but i never really focused
              on learning it and it was futile work to me at the time, because i
              had no idea where to head next.

              As I continue my educational journey, I am excited to pursue my
              interests in programming and graphic design. Although here that
              the school also provides me with religious lessons, they also gave
              a focus on programming and coding. This is the reason why i
              decided to join this school.

              <br />
              <br />

              My time at this school made me more independent for myself and
              non-relying on others. I was able to learn more about myself and
              my surroundings and what purpose i want and i was destined to
              achieve. I am still countinuing to be more capable to achieve my
              goals and dreams.

              <br />
              <br />
              At SMP, SMA Pondok Tahfizh Plus Abu Dzar, I have been learning
              more about programming and coding. The school provides me with a
              good environment to learn and focus on my interests. I am excited
              to continue learning and growing in this field. I am excited to
              see where this journey will take me and what kind of projects I
              will be able to create in the future.
